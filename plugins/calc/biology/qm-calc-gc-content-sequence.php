            <ol><li><strong>Collect the inputs.</strong> You need Sequence and Window size. Write them down in the unit the chip shows before you type, because the conversion happens inside the page and a mixed set of units is the commonest wrong answer.</li><li><strong>Enter them and press Calculate.</strong> Type Sequence into the form and press the button. The results appear in the panel; nothing is submitted anywhere and no account is needed.</li><li><strong>Read the answer against the defaults.</strong> Compare Length in bp with the figure the page&#039;s own defaults give. A result of the same order of magnitude is credible; one that is ten or a hundred times out is almost always a unit or a decimal point.</li><li><strong>Change one box to check your understanding.</strong> The last step is a check, not a calculation: move one box and see that the answer moves the way the formula says it should. When it does, the answer is yours to use.</li></ol><p>Nothing above needs an account, a download or a second visit: the page works the same way the first time and the hundredth.</p>

            <ul><li><strong>It scales in a straight line.</strong> The relationship behind Length is a straight-line one: proportionally more input gives proportionally more output, which is what makes the sensitivity table above a set of constants rather than a curve.</li><li><strong>It is a formula, not a model of your case.</strong> Nothing here corrects for measurement error, correlation between the inputs, or conditions outside the range the relationship was written for. Those are assumptions a reader brings; the arithmetic simply does what it says.</li></ul>

            The arithmetic runs at full precision and only the display of Length is rounded. Rounding twice — once by hand, once by the page — is what makes two answers that should match differ in the last digit.
